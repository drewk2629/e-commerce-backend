# e-commerce-backend
"AS A manager at an internet retail company
I WANT a back end for my e-commerce website that uses the latest technologies
SO THAT my company can compete with other e-commerce companies"

## About the Project
This project uses express.js and sequelize to interact with MySQL and build the back end database for an e-commerce website. You have to source the schema with MySQL and then run the seeds from the command line in the root directory. Then start the server with npm start server.js

Using a tool like Insomnia you can then get all the data back from the database, create new data for the database, as well as delete. (CRUD)


## Technologies Used
express, mysql, sequelize, insomnia (for route testing)
